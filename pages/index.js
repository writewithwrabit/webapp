          <p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹</p>

          <p>
            Due to the cost of running Wrabit, we've had to shut down the
            service. This <strong>not</strong> goodbye.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are working hard to bring you a free privacy focused
            micro-journal.
          </p>

          <p>
            No more saving your journal entries to the cloud. No more monthly
            payments. Just you and your thoughts, daily.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thanks to everyone who gave our first product a try. We hope you'll
            like what we've got in store. See you soon!
          </p>

          <p>- Your friends at Wrabit</p>
